**To Add:**

- Auth/login. Currently I'm just saving user tasks/categories via a generated userID that's saved to a cookie. I want to implement auth so that users can access their tasks/categories everywhere if they'd like.
- Spice up the completion of tasks with sounds and animations
- Edit task (I know, I should have already implemented this. My b.)
- Ability to upload and add background images
- Ability to move categories around
- Ability to Undo (have to update database for this)
- Tasks completed count for the session

**To fix:**
- Make the layout more responsive/add a mobile layout
- Debounce clicks for completing tasks
- Generally fix 'task completed count'
- Fix the patch request for moving tasks between categories
- Fix the patch request for moving tasks from General Tasks to a category using the plus button
